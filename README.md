#### Description:
ProvidencePCT is a cryptocurrency investment simulation platform oriented towards the purpose<br>
of enlightening its users regarding the precarious nature of this particular domain of financial<br>
investment so that, in actuality, they may be all the more well equipped to be able to competently<br>

###### Semantics
The acronym PCT denotes *Pseudo Cryptocurrency Trading*. The utilization of the word Providence<br>
refers to, within this context, the state of being provident, defined as follows:

>Providence: the quality or state of being provident ~ making provision for the future ~ Prudent

###### Introduction
Welcome to ProvidencePCT, a cryptocurrency investment simulation platform designed to educate and<br>
prime its benefactors for the exciting world of digital currency investments. The name ProvidencePCT is<br>
derived from two key concepts: "Providence", meaning the quality of being provident or making provisions<br>
for the future, and "PCT", an acronym for Pseudo Cryptocurrency Trading. The platform serves as a risk-free and<br>
educational environment for both newcomers and those familiar yet hesitant about cryptocurrency investment.

###### What Problem(s) Are Solved?
Cryptocurrency, a rapidly evolving and volatile financial domain, often manifests a daunting challenge for many. The lack of<br>
understanding and the fear associated with volatile investment environments can deter many potential investors.<br>
ProvidencePCT targets this issue by providing a simulated trading environment where users can learn, experiment,<br>
and gain confidence without taking on any financial risk.

##### Platform Overview

###### Authentication and User Onboarding
The software begins on an authentication page, featuring a dynamic typing effect that cycles through various crypto-related<br>
phrases. Here, users can either sign up for a new account or log in to an existing one. The sign-up process is secure, <br>
requiring alphanumeric usernames, passwords with a minimum length of eight characters, and additional validation methodologies.

###### Portfolio Page
Once logged in, users are directed to the portfolio page. New users start with a virtual balance of $100,000. This page<br>
prompts users to explore the marketplace and start their investment journey.

###### Marketplace and Cryptocurrency Data
The marketplace is the central feature of ProvidencePCT. It includes a search field where users can enter a cryptocurrency ticker.<br>
Valid tickers lead to detailed information pages displaying data like high/low prices over different time frames, a 30-day closing<br>
price graph implemented using Chart.js, recent percent changes, and other relevant statistics. Users can make simulated purchases of<br>
cryptocurrencies, assuming they have sufficient (virtual) funds.

###### Portfolio Management
Post-purchase, users are redirected to their updated portfolio, showcasing their cash balance, holdings (and their aggregated value), and total portfolio value.<br>
Further, a polar area chart (Chart.js) is utilized to illustrate, visually, via percentage representations, the magnitude of various holdings relative to total account value and<br>
a detailed breakdown with respect to the composition of their portfolio. Users can view their performance since account inception, both in percentage and monetary terms. The<br>
portfolio page also allows for selling cryptocurrencies, dynamically updating the relevant financial metrics using AJAX for a seamless experience.

###### Additional Features
- News Page: Keeps users informed with the latest cryptocurrency news.
- History Page: Displays a user's transaction history, including both purchases and sales.

###### Technical Considerations and Design Choices
ProvidencePCT is built with a focus on user experience, user interface, and efficient data handling. Two key APIs are integrated: CoinMarketCap<br>
for financial data and GNews for current news. While AJAX is employed for dynamic content updating, it was consciously not extended to every page<br>
to prevent excessive API request rates, balancing the trade-offs between functionality and technical limitations.

###### Conclusion
ProvidencePCT is not just a digital currency investment simulation platform; it's an educational tool designed to demystify the world of cryptocurrency.<br>
It offers users a risk-free environment to learn, understand, and get comfortable with the concepts and practices of crypto investment. Our goal is to<br>
empower users with the knowledge and confidence needed to navigate this seemingly inexorable future of financial investment.
